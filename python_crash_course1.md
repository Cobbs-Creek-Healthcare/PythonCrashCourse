Week 1 is in the books, and it is time for our way too early python crash course **<span style="color:green">POWER RANKINGS!!</span>** The theme this week is going to be categories because I got a surprising (pleasant) number of entries to end the day. Amazing job everyone that has submitted, and if you havenâ€™t thatâ€™s okay thereâ€™s still plenty of time ðŸ˜‰.

## **<span style="font-family: 'Copperplate Gothic'; font-style=bold;">Kadan</span>**

#### Kadan Lottick
Itâ€™s tough to win best python trainee when youâ€™re the subject expert but when you send answers in binary the grading scale doesnâ€™t quite know how to handle that.

## **<span style="font-family: 'Copperplate Gothic'; font-style=bold;">Clubhose Leaders</span>**

#### Maxwell Miller
Clean code, early submission, cheeky joke in the reply email.. not much more you could ask from Max early on. People are wondering if his python skill was elite before he even enrolled for the class, though.

#### Richard Hong
I think this entry came before I even sent out the assignment. Thatâ€™s going to be tough to beat.

## **<span style="font-family: 'Copperplate Gothic'; font-style=bold;">No Nonsense</span>**

#### Jonah Schiavo
Is there anything better in life than just getting sent a wall of code? I guess thatâ€™s what I deserve for assigning homework. Code was right though.

#### Brian Ferrell 
Screenshot of the output. Love that. I trust you, donâ€™t worry.

## **<span style="font-family: 'Copperplate Gothic'; font-style=bold;">Under Promise over deliver</span>**

Nothing better than letting me know you might not be able to get it done in time because of deliverables and still producing! Unfortunately, this is my go-to strategy so I canâ€™t give you too many bonus points lolol. Just kidding, I appreciate you guys still getting this done.

#### Michael Sindaco

#### Martin Bohdan

## **<span style="font-family: 'Copperplate Gothic'; font-style=bold;">Aidans</span>**
Speaks for itself. This group is going to fight to the end for Best Aidan.

#### John Mangan
Earliest entry of the Aidans. Something to be said for being fast out the gate. Does he have the endurance to keep it up? Weâ€™ll find out, hopefully.

#### Aidan Mangan 
Veteran presence but I must dock points for leaving the generic email and message as the first item in the list. If I got that email Iâ€™m hitting unsubscribe immediately and probably dying horribly because thereâ€™s no chance I return it. Lives are on the line!!

#### Aidan Kelly
Rich Strike?

## **<span style="font-family: 'Copperplate Gothic'; font-style=bold;">I should go to office hours tomorrow and say hi to Brendan</span>**

#### Nate Philip

## **<span style="font-family: 'Copperplate Gothic'; font-style=bold;">In The Hunt</span>**

Iâ€™ve spent way too much time making myself laugh at this point. But this group deserves props for just getting the job done. And you can easily jump up to a clubhouse leader if you bring me dirt on the current top dogs ðŸ˜Š

#### Aaron Tsai

#### Nick Pyrih

#### Daniel Frame

#### Trevor Beresford

#### Alex Zilli

#### Thomas Ragone


## **<span style="font-family: 'Copperplate Gothic'; font-style=bold;">PTO no excuses</span>**

#### Will Baar 
Snapchats of you â€˜watchingâ€™ the trainings donâ€™t count, even if youâ€™re on PTO. I guess with the time change EOD means something different for you. Itâ€™s 5 oâ€™clock somewhere.. and Iâ€™m still waiting.

## **<span style="font-family: 'Copperplate Gothic'; font-style=bold;">THE FIELD</span>**

## **<span style="font-family: 'Copperplate Gothic'; font-style=bold;">Kadan</span>**

#### Kadan Lottick
