Wow. What a second week of python training. The effort and accountability displayed actually warms my heart as I got so many submissions this week. Some people more than once! And with that, we have our updated **<span style="color:green">POWER RANKINGS!!!</span>**

## **<span style="font-family: 'Copperplate Gothic'; font-style=bold;">CLUBHOUSE LEADERS</span>**

#### Madison Rhine
The effort here might be unmatched. Multiple entries, fixing mistakes without me mentioning anything and going back to finish the first assignment after PTO. Using dictionaries and loops to solve this one was v creative. New leader in the clubhouse. Sheesh. What a little time off can do. Speaking of which, we’re almost to the long weekend everyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

#### Maxwell Miller
Now even I'm starting to wonder if you're sandbagging. Superb job, again...

#### Richard Hong
Same as before. If you want to pass Richard you might have to bog him down with some high priority deliverables because this is getting ridiculous. Let me know if it's too easy man!!

#### Michael Sindaco
PandasSQL?! Sheeesh. Guy spends a few nights in New England and comes back coding like Kadan.

#### Aaron Tsai
Answers at the top of the notebook. He knows how this goes. Job well done.

## **<span style="font-family: 'Copperplate Gothic'; font-style=bold;">NO NONSENSE</span>**

#### Martin Bohdan
Some of the cleanest code I've looked at so far. Even added in a little rounding function to make the average a nice clean 80. I'm not sure if it's better or worse but I like it.

#### Trevor Beresford
One cell. 8 lines of code. This is the most no nonsense answer I've ever seen. I guess this is what happens when he finishes up his final exams. Something must be in that WCU water.

#### Nick Pyrih
Clean entry again. You even showed me how many customers are silly and listed Daisy as their favorite. Abby must've bought ten beds or something??

#### Banu Nathan
Easily my favorite entry. Utilized the f strings and even printed out which customers are smart enough to list Brian H as their favorite. Now I know which 10 people to send flowers to. Amazing job!

## **<span style="font-family: 'Copperplate Gothic'; font-style=bold;">UP AND COMING</span>**

#### Jonah Brous
Watched him struggle on this more than anything I've ever seen. And then it ended up being sent to me in Spanish. Little did he know I won the Spanish award in HS (among many other awards) so this was just a superb entry. Buen trabajo

#### Alex Zilli
Great job. I smell some office hour attendance which only gives you bonus points. Rubbing it in that 14 people chose Daisy does the opposite, though.

#### Thomas Ragone
What. A. Comeback. I'm proud to sit next to him day in and day out. From doing the wrong assignment to destroying assignment 2 this is how you make a name for yourself!!

#### Daniel Frame
Super clean code. Felt like I was reading a beautiful github tutorial. But even if it's true 47 people think I'm the best, only 10 bed buyers do ;-)

#### Nate Philip
I see you took the advice to heart and went to office hours. Great work, I'll be sad to see you go after you found your python stride!! Add it to the resume tho.

## **<span style="font-family: 'Copperplate Gothic'; font-style=bold;">AIDANS</span>**

#### John Mangan
Another great response from John Aidan Mangan. You can tell he's taking this one to heart. Naming the list Brian's Fanclub is a great touch that I was always going to notice. Bruv found another gear. 1/3 of the race left.

#### Aidan Mangan 
After nearly killing everyone last week Aidan 1.0 had another promising entry with a tiny mistake. Forgot to limit the item to only beds smh. Luckily, no lives were at stake this time, but the Aidan 2.0+ are separating and there's not much race left.

#### Aidan Kelly
People are asking who is that #21 horse. Epicenter bettors (me) are starting to get out of their seats. This could get bad.

## **<span style="font-family: 'Copperplate Gothic'; font-style=bold;">WILL</span>**

#### Will Baar 
I wish I was joking but none of the files you sent to me worked on Jupyter so I had to actually read every line of code and imagine the output… Unreal. You’re lucky I’m not going to be home. Cooked a great steak last night though.

## **<span style="font-family: 'Copperplate Gothic'; font-style=bold;">THE FIELD</span>**
Jun was asking about this group. Send it.
